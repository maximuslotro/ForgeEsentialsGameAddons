Run ./gradlew eclipse to build the classpath and generate eclipse files.

If having eclipse problems, use the following commands:

First try cleaning the Eclipse configuration completely. 
./gradlew cleanEclipse

If that doesn't work you may try more specific tasks: 
./gradlew cleanEclipseProject       to remove the .project file
./gradlew cleanEclipseClasspath     to empty the project's classpath

Finally to rebuild the Eclipse configuration
./gradlew eclipse

Finally to build launch files for Eclipse
./gradlew genEclipseRuns
